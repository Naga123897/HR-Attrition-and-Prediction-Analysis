# HR-Attrition-and-Prediction-Analysis
Employee attrition is one of the most pressing challenges faced by organizations today. When employees leave, companies not only lose valuable skills but also face increased costs in hiring, training, and maintaining workforce stability. This project, HR Attrition Analytics, focuses on analyzing HR data to understand the underlying reasons behind employee turnover and to provide data-driven insights that can help organizations strengthen employee retention strategies.

The dataset used in this project contains records of 151 employees, including demographic, educational, and professional details such as age, gender, marital status, education field, department, job role, monthly income, business travel frequency, and tenure. Out of these, 12 employees had left, leading to an attrition rate of 7.95%. While this number may not appear critical, the analysis highlights patterns that can help prevent future workforce challenges.

The project was developed using Power BI as the primary tool for building an interactive and dynamic dashboard. The dashboard brings together KPIs, charts, and slicers to filter data and explore factors influencing attrition. Key KPIs include total employees, attrition rate, average employee age, and average monthly income. Slicers such as Age Group, Department, Business Travel, and Education Field make the analysis more insightful and user-friendly.

From the analysis, several patterns emerged:

The highest attrition was observed among employees aged 26–35, indicating career exploration and job-hopping in early professional stages.

Low salary brackets (under ₹5,000) showed the most attrition, emphasizing the strong link between compensation and retention.

R&D and Sales departments recorded higher turnover compared to IT and HR, pointing toward stress and limited growth opportunities.

Single and male employees were more likely to leave, suggesting lifestyle and external opportunities play a role.

Employees with Life Sciences and Technical degrees faced higher attrition, possibly due to higher demand for these skills in the job market.

The insights led to actionable recommendations such as increasing pay for low salary ranges, introducing career development plans for young employees, managing workload in high-pressure departments, and aligning employees’ educational backgrounds with suitable roles.

By combining analytics with visualization, this project demonstrates how data-driven HR strategies can reduce attrition, improve job satisfaction, and build a more sustainable workforce.
